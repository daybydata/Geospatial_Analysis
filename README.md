# Geospatial_Analysis
This notebook contains preliminary steps in a geospatial analysis. It demonstrates the use of the hvplot library to explore data with interactive charts and maps.

## Technologies

This workbook was written in python 3.7. It uses the following libraries:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For dataframe tools and quantitative analysis.

* [pathlib](https://github.com/budlight/pathlib) - For importing and reading csv files.

* [hvplot](https://github.com/holoviz/hvplot) - For creating interactive charts and map.

The first (sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv) contains information on housing units, sales price per square foot, and gross rents. The latitude and longitude of the central point in the neighborhood are available in neighborhoods_coordinates.csv.
